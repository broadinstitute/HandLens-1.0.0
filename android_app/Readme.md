# HandLens Installation and Usage

1. Download [HandLens](https://github.com/broadinstitute/Handlens/raw/master/android_app/HandLens-v1.2.apk) on your Android device (iOS support currently in development)
2. Enable sideloading of applications on your Android device: this can be done by accessing the Security menu within the Android Settings, and setting "Enable Unknown Sources" to "Allow"
3. Open the downloaded HandLens file on your Android device, select install to install.
4. To use HandLens, simply open the in-app camera, capture a picture of your fluorescent readout, and overlay the tube locator box on the image. After pressing upload, our cloud-based system will interpret and return your results!

Note: the next version of HandLens, currently under development, will no longer require sideloading of the application (and will be available through Play Store and Apple Store); and will perform computational analysis on-device.
